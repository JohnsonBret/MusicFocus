                        sequencers, keyboards or anything else - please supply your OWN special amplifier or P.A. system.
                        UNFORTUNATELY - we don't allow mics on drumsets, or any drum-triggers in our P.A.
                        The P.A. and adjoining microphones, mic stands & cords, drum set, bass, and guitar
                        amplifiers are all available to use - EQUIPMENT.

                        Best idea, if you value it, don't leave it. If you think you've left an item, CALL US! Don't call after 3 weeks,
                            and wonder "where's my cowbell" (for real, it happened...).

                        <p>Please use our new "mini" pay envelopes! Just put your name or band-name
                        on the envelope and pop it in the box!</p> 

                        <p>It's pretty simple - Bands with an unpaid "balance" can't book again until they've settled up. No Popeye's Wimpy saying - "I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a rehearsal today". Sorry, no tabs! No "partial payments" will be accepted. Partial payments are not counted and will be returned to you. Only full payments are accepted.</p> 
                        <p>Your priority to book is actually based on the past result of your part of the
                        agreement, respect of the facility and payment in full. Like a punk song, simple but powerful!
                        99% of our bands are respectful and this is not even an issue... Thank you!!! Peace!!</p>

                    <p>Please plan to bring a "good" regular guitar cord. Please do NOT bring a crappy molded plastic Walmart guitar cord (sorry Walmart, I do like your cashews)...
                    A bad guitar cord will break, sound terrible and possibly mess with our guitar amps, which you'll be responsible for. 
                    Good guitar cords are quite common. </p>  
                    <h3>ALWAYS PUT YOUR CORD 'BEHIND' YOUR GUITAR STRAP FOR SAFETY AND protection of your/our guitars</h3> 
                    <h3>THIS IS ESSENTIAL OR YOU'LL BE ASKED TO NOT USE OUR GUITARS.</h3> 
                    <p>IF you don't stress relieve (put the cord behind the strap) while you play, you'll most likely- 1. embarrass yourself by unplugging
                    your guitar as you play your solo... 2. BREAK your/our guitar jack causing personal embarrassment and monetary embarrassment.
                    If you'd like to hear about MY embarrassing "cord unpluggage" episode on stage at the Troubadour in 1977, happy to oblidge!</p>
