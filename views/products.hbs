                <h3>The Musicians</h3>
                <p>Karl Frederick Grossman began forming the songs for this album in early 1990. With Rich Schwagerl on vibraphone, Mike McLinden on bass as well as Gary Ferguson on drums, the band began playing and rehearsing the music to be recorded. For a year we rehearsed and refined new tunes and old ones. We came up with a viable set of music that eventually became the Picture Tube album.</p>
                <p>We basically performed the album at the Strand nightclub in the summer of 1994. </p>
                <p>The band was then ready to start laying the tracks that would become the album. We started with about 15 tunes and narrowed it down to the current 10 tunes. </p>
                <p>Richard and I became very much entwined in the melodic process of the tunes and we would have to 'woodshed' by oursleves many times to get the phrasing and nuance just right.</p>
                <p>The recording was very time consuming and detailed but we tried to put as much raw spirit as possible on the recorder. As an result of the that concept very little doubling or thickening was employed. We preferred the raw sound of the instruments. It was the players I believe who are totally responsible for the interaction and resultant 'magic'.</p>
                <p>A musical score of the whole CD exists. E-mail me to find out more...</p>

                <h3>CD #1 - Series I Progression Lessons</h3>
                <p>These are 2 chord progressions designed to "get you going" playing good rhythm as well as soloing. They are designed to give you ear training in both major and minor sounds. Since the progressions are "genderless" regarding major or minor, YOU decide and get the benefit of hearing melodic ideas in either quality while consciously making those choices. Creative AND conscious ear training! </p>

                <h3>CD #2 - Series II MAJOR Progression Lessons</h3>
                <p>These are Major key progressions. The 4 suggested scale formats that you improvise around are written in 6 different keys to give you a workout in many locations on the neck. Depending on the access of your upper frets, you should be able to explore the outer extremities of the guitar. It's all about keeping your place, experimenting, playing smoothly and in time. </p>

                <h3>CD #3 - Series III Minor Progression Lessons</h3>
                <p>These are simple and complex minor key progressions. The suggested scales that you improvise around are written in 6 different keys to give you a diverse workout on the neck. Depending on the order of the chords, there might be a necessary "mode change". The later examples require you to move through the modes within the progressions themselves. This is fairly advanced. HOWEVER, by playing pentatonics only, you can avoid any "problem notes" altogether. The best guitarists know how to mode change and yet many use the pentatonic "trick" as well!!</p>
